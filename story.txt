My name is Timothy Shenanigans and once upon a time I was teleported to the city of Berlin with nothing but the clothes on my back, this is my story.

I stood in my pajamas on an abandoned, dimly lit street, with only the familiar smell of freshly baked pastries from the mom-and-pop Baeckerei nearby.

A man in Lederhose stumbled out of the Ratskeller and smiled when he smelled the sweet bready treats.

A BMW with Rammstein blaring from the stereo raced down the street and screeched to a halt in front of the man.

Der kleine Hund gracefully stepped out of the vehicle sporting his dirndil proudly and promptly walks up to Timothy,"Der Apfelkuchen ist einfach das beste Geback."
